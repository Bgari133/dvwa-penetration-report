# üìÑ **DVWA File Inclusion Report**

# Local File Inclusion (LFI) Attack (Low Security Level)

## ‚úÖ Security Level

DVWA Security Level: **Low**

---
## üîç Vulnerable Field

The **page** parameter in the **File Inclusion** module, which allows user-supplied input to define which file is included.

---
## üí• Payload Example

To read `/etc/passwd` (Linux sensitive file):

```
?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

---
## üì∏ Result

The contents of `/etc/passwd` are displayed in the browser, proving successful file inclusion.
(See screenshot: [file_inclusion.jpg](screenshots/file_inclusion.jpg))

---
## üß† How the Vulnerability Works

- The application includes files based on user input **without proper sanitization or validation**.
- This allows attackers to perform **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** by specifying a path to sensitive files on the server.
- If combined with file upload or log poisoning, LFI can escalate to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
---
## üîß Using Burp Suite

- Intercept the request to the File Inclusion module.
- Modify the `page` parameter to inject LFI payloads.
- Use Burp's Repeater to test multiple payloads quickly.
---
## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation

- **Whitelist Files:** Only allow predefined files to be included.
- **Sanitize Input:** Use strict validation to prevent directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Disable Dynamic Includes:** Avoid including files based on user input wherever possible.
